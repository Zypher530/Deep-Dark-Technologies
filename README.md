## Releases
- *Comming soon*

## 🌌 Overview

**Deep Dark Technologies** is a story-driven, progression-based modpack set in an underground research facility. You begin in Section Zero of the Prometheus Facility—humanity's final archive of technology. Your mission: unlock each sealed chamber, master the systems within, and construct a vessel capable of reaching the stars.

This is **NOT** a kitchen sink pack. Every mod serves the story. Every room unlocks new possibilities. Every technology brings you closer to escape.
